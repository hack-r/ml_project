## About the Data
The data used in this project are from the WLE dataset.

For a link, description, and proper citation of the data please see the CodeBook.md file.

## About the Project
This is a project to satisfy in part the requirements of Coursera's Practical Machine Learning course.

## Background

From the text of the assignment:

>Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website here: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).

## Prediction Assignment Submission: Instructions
>Please apply the machine learning algorithm you built to each of the 20 test cases in the testing data set. For more information and instructions on how to build your model see the prediction assignment writeup. For each test case you should submit a text file with a single capital letter (A, B, C, D, or E) corresponding to your prediction for the corresponding problem in the test data set. You get 1 point for each correct answer. You may submit up to 2 times for each problem. I know it is a lot of files to submit. It may be helpful to use the following function to create the files. If you have a character vector with your 20 predictions in order for the 20 problems.
